Communication tool for seniors (think Grandmum and Grandad)

Very simple signup process (either set up a community [your name, your password, community name], or join one [your name, community name and password])

Could have everything as global to start with (makes it easier to understand too - and encourages small communities) - can still add a live filter on so you can type in someone's or your name or some word to see it all filter in realtime. So just one main page - the news feed (but call it something simple)

Make sure all buttons have the same style, so you know what you can click on (i.e. black text on orange background, or within a circle, or something)

You then have a button to click to add content, gives you very simple options:
Which of the following do you want to add?
- WORDS (--> you can use typing or speech recognition)
- PICTURE (--> a photo from your webcam, a picture of something[we'll pick the options from google so you don't have to leave the page])
- SOMETHING ELSE  (--> you can then choose between youtube video or grooveshark(?) link)

Probably need an 'about me' page too, where you can just have your name, password, photo

Default have a set of X characters for the community (picture-wise), e.g. a set of 15 animal cartoons, which are spread around the community by default. You can replace with your own photo

Maaaybe if you click on someone else's picture it adds their name to the filter so you see only their posts and posts mentioning them
