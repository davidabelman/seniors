Communication tool for seniors (think Grandmum and Grandad)

Very simple signup process (either set up a community [your name, your password, community name], or join one [your name, community name and password])

Could have everything as global to start with (makes it easier to understand too - and encourages small communities) - can still add a live filter on so you can type in someone's or your name or some word to see it all filter in realtime. So just one main page - the news feed (but call it something simple)

Make sure all buttons have the same style, so you know what you can click on (i.e. black text on orange background, or within a circle, or something)

You then have a button to click to add content, gives you very simple options:
Which of the following do you want to add?
- WORDS (--> you can use typing or speech recognition)
- PICTURE (--> a photo from your webcam, a picture of something[we'll pick the options from google so you don't have to leave the page])
- SOMETHING ELSE  (--> you can then choose between youtube video or grooveshark(?) link)

Probably need an 'about me' page too, where you can just have your name, password, photo

Default have a set of X characters for the community (picture-wise), e.g. a set of 15 animal cartoons, which are spread around the community by default. You can replace with your own photo

Maaaybe if you click on someone else's picture it adds their name to the filter so you see only their posts and posts mentioning them

///////////////////////////////
Backend:



*** create heroku staging account
*** add 'see more posts' at bottom or automatically load
*** fix double firing of post checks (just record time of last check, and use within an if statment)
*** some sort of email to keep people engaged (either daily update, or maybe one every few days if they haven't posted)
*** Email opt-out
*** make enter/group/name log straight in if they are already logged in with session
** investigate testing with selenium
** forgot password feature (and if they don't have an email, it would have to send email to admin to reset it for them)

main page 
** update moment js every now and again
** add notification for new messages
* colour new messages as they pop up

** Add users - fade opposite half of the screen
** clean up posts.js and add_image.js
** Add some webcam hint/message to help switch on
** write better help file


* Link 'add image' page and feed page (either link or on same page, just jquery between them with slide in) 
* dictate functionality
* add video
* colour messages by ObjID and not by name==name

* do profile picture by ObjID (i.e. have it in hidden field when posts is loaded, then when you draw HTML to screen you look up the animal of the ObjID... probably should do the same for 'Name' as well actually)

* try to login without confirming token, message (i.e. if password_hash = '', it should tell them to follow their email token to create a password)

Here's the thing:
session variable doesn't want to properly clear. Not sure if it's O2 wifi or something. HTTPS seems to work. Mobile 3g seems to work.
workaround may be to store logged in status in mongodb. Don't want to check mongodb every single time someone goes back to the homepage (probably)
I can use
request.headers['Referer']--->   Referer: http://localhost:5000/add_image
to see where user came from when they try to load the home page. If they came from /add_image or /settings or /help then we don't need to check their logged in status(???? but what if they weren't logged in on the other pages either, argh) ... otherwise we make a quick call to the database to check if they're logged in

Also the before_request is firing for every little js file etc... more efficient to just fire on HTML?


At Midday -
For each user:
- check they have email
- check they have confirmed account
- check they have not unsubscribed
- check last time seen on site
- find all posts since this time
- find all posters of these since this time
- create email message based on these
